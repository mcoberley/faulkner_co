        "text": "Christopher Phillips, who has been wanted on several felony warrants, has been taken into custody! On July 20, 2021, Information was obtained that Mr. Phillips was hiding in a local residence. Faulkner County Sheriff's Deputies, with the assistance of the U.S. Marshals, Arkansas State Police, and Conway Police Department, received permission to search the residence and located Mr. Phillips hiding in the attic. Deputies observed a black motorcycle at the residence, shown to be stolen out of North Little Rock. U.S. Marshals attempted to make contact with Mr. Phillips in the attic, identifying themselves and advising him to come down. When Mr. Phillips failed to respond, deputies and officers entered the attic. Mr. Phillips immediately began resisting arrest and fighting with the deputies and officers, and he unsuccessfully attempted to remove the taser from one of the officers. At that time, deputies were able to detain Mr. Phillips. Mr. Phillips is currently housed in the Faulkner County Detention Center on the following charges: Aggravated Residential Burglary (Class Y Felony), Possession of Firearms by Certain Persons (2 Counts Class D Felonies, 1 Count Class B Felony), Possession of a Defaced Firearm (Class D Felony), 3rd degree Domestic Battery (Class D Felony), 1st Degree Terroristic Threatening (Class D Felony), Fleeing- Vehicle or Conveyance (Class A Misdemeanor), Fleeing- On Foot (Class C Misdemeanor), Theft by Receiving (Class D Felony), Resisting Arrest (Class A Misdemeanor). He is also the subject of several additional ongoing investigations at this time."

Ms. Diamond exited the vehicle and was captured on foot. Deputies secured medical assistance for Ms. Diamond for injuries sustained during the escape, and she was transported back to Unit 2.

When deputies attempted to stop the vehicle, the driver, later identified as Jerimy Gadberry, did not slow down or stop. Mr. Gadberry continued westbound for several miles and used the oncoming traffic lane to pass several other vehicles. Several vehicles were forced to move over in an effort to avoid being struck by Mr. Gadberry.\u00a0 Mr. Gadberry continued at speeds between 85-90mph. Once Mr. Gadberry approached Skunk Hollow Rd., he locked up his brakes in an attempt to get deputies to collide with him. He then increased speed at the intersection of Highway 286. He continued traveling at high speeds through three parking lots of local businesses with workers present, swerved to avoid a light pole, and continued southbound down Drillers Dr., jumping Highway 286 without slowing or checking for traffic.\u00a0 Deputies caught back up with Mr. Gadberry at Caney Creek Rd and Amity Rd, where he blew through a stop sign and wrecked his vehicle while attempting to turn onto Betty Lane. Mr. Gadberry crawled over his passenger and attempted to exit the passenger side window. Deputies successfully took Mr. Gadberry into custody at this time, but he began banging his head on the window of the patrol vehicle. After being cleared by medical personnel, he was transported to Faulkner County Detention Center Unit 2. He remains housed with no bond on felony charges of Fleeing and Aggravated Assault, additional misdemeanor charges, and an Extradition Hold from Colorado."
